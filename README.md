Hello_World
===========
Trying to enter the world of big data to push my frontier of science.

First try 
###List
Unordered 
* apples
* bananas
* oranges
* pinapple

Now I am typing a sentence but in the same paragraph I want to start a new line.  
So I did the double space thing. It should work right? 

  Testing the new thing here now. As one should see the text is a new paragraph.
  THis should be just a continuation _right_?  
  But this is a new sentence but within the __same__ paragraph.
Man this is all new to me!!

    I want to indent this text.  
    I also want this to be a sentence that is part of the paragraph.  
    AS well as this one
    
This should be a new paragraph that is not indented.    
   

   
Ok now I am going to try and add a [__link__] (http://www.bbc.com/) to one of the first websites I check each morning.
To be very specific I usually go to the [__sport__] (http://www.bbc.com/sport/0) section of the site.
